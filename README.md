prestashop
==========

This is a prestashop module. tested with version 1.5.x

This module is used to create a bundle product. 

Real time example. In a store we would like to give offer based on single product or else if customer bought three product together then the discount will be applied.

Here in my module it works like this.

Say I have 5 categories and each category have 10 products.

I wanted to make quick sale and here is my offer using this module.

From each category it allows us to add one product and make a bundle will be treated as single product. In actual the single product will be sold.
But indirectly we are selling five products.

This module will update the quantity as well from each product.
